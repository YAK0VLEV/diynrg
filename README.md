### Who We Are:

Hello! We are a team of students from the University of Washington Tacoma.

At FKMD we realize how rewarding, and economical it is to do Do-It-Yourself projects. As a
result, we have realized that there is no current software (yet!) that enables users to
manage their projects.

With our project management software DIY: money matters , individuals will be able to
making DIY-ing around the house more organized, and manageable. It will also help users
gauge the worth of a DIY, with statistical information.


### Who Can Benefit [Beware! Some functions have not implemented yet.]:

Everyone. Although our software was initially intended for the pro-DIY-ers, our software
can be a tool to help turn an amateur DIY to an expert.

We want to help making DIY-ing easier by organizing, and displaying data that is
already there, but unused.

Our software can be used to decide whether or not to do a DIY. Specifically, users can
get a graphical representation of costs and savings, making deciding to do doing a DIY
easier.

Our software can also be used to keep a record of the DIY, keeping costs, prices, and
what you did.
